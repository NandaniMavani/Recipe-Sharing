      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">

Despite many cooking enthusiasts and a vast number of recipes available online, there is a need for a centralized and u
ser-friendly platform that encourages active recipe sharing and culinary exploration. The few existing platforms for 
sharing recipes sometimes fall short of giving users a comprehensive and interactive culinary experience. 
They lack elements that encourage user customization, community building, and access to essential nutritional data. 
Users are thus left in need of a more capable and interesting platform for their culinary research. 
Additionally, many platforms do not consider diverse dietary, limiting the exposure of a wide range of recipes. 
It may be difficult for users with certain dietary demands or preferences to modify recipes to meet their specific needs. 
For people trying to maintain a healthy and balanced diet, this lack of flexibility can be a major roadblock.
 In light of these limitations, RecipeShare aims to bridge these gaps by offering a platform that not only provides a
  wide variety of recipes but also prioritizes community-building, user customization. By doing so, RecipeShare aims to 
  create a lively and exciting environment where foodies of all skill levels can meet up to share, learn about, and celebrate 
  their love for cooking and eating.

          As a user I should be able to create, share and collaborate in creation of different recipes, and get 
          tips and tricks to improve existing recipes.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
          As a person I should be able to get feedback of my recipes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Actions</h3>
      <ul class="text-justify">
        <li>User should be able to register/login to the website</li>
        <li>
          User should be able to upload the recipes on the website. The user 
            can enter different things like title, ingredient list, detailed instructions like
            cooking time.
        </li>
        <li>
          User should be able to search the recipe.
        </li>
        <li>User should be able to categorize the recipes like breakfast, lunch, dinner.</li>
        <li>
          User should be able to comment on existig recipes
        </li>
        <li>
            User should be able to send their favorite recipes on social media platform.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Potential obstacles</h3>
      <ul class="text-justify">
        <li>
          User data need to be handled safely in an end to end encrypted
          environment.
        </li>
        <li>
            As the users grow day by day, we should make sure that our website must be able to handle it and shouldn’t affect the website’s performance. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Since there are many recipe sharing websites, we should be way more creative and provide additional features to be unique and more captivating. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Plagiarism is one of the main constraints for this recipe sharing website. Even if the recipe is unique, pictures used for the respective dish may be owned by someone else. So we should be careful with plagiarism and check it more often. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The main constraint to this website will be the User Engagement. If the users don’t post the recipes regularly, the website fails to reach its goal. And also the website must reach a wider audience to make it engaging as the recipes increase.
        </li>
