        For Mark, as a user, he wants to learn and explore different varieties of recipes.
Through this practice, he also wants to gain his lost interest in cooking back.
To gain his interest back, we need to make sure that the website reaches a wide section of the
audience so that the website is engaged all the time so that the users can help each other out.

      For Hailey, as a user and also as a professional cook, she wants to share her recipes with other
      users and learn different recipes from the other users. Even for this, the website's engagement
      is very important and also reviewing the posted recipes by different users will also help them in
      improving their cooking styles. As Hailey participated as a judge in many competitions, review
      system in the website is also very important.
